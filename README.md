# ROS2 GoPro Driver

## Overview
The `ros2_gopro_driver` package is a work-in-progress ROS2 driver for interfacing with GoPro cameras. This package aims to provide functionality for controlling GoPro cameras and accessing their data streams within a ROS2 ecosystem.

## Status
This package is currently under development and is not functional yet. Contributions and feedback are welcome as we work towards building a robust driver.
